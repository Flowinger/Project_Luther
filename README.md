Project Luther

This is the second project at Metis bootcamp. I used information I scraped from the web in order to build regression models that predict the current market value of players in the top five European soccer leagues.

My goal was to look into which factors have the most impact on the market value of a player and determine if the player is over-/ or undervalued.
